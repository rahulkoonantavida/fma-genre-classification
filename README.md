• Dataset: https://github.com/mdeff/fma (processed data available upon request (500MB+ file size))

• Extracted Mel Spectrogram values from raw audio data to strengthen feature set for model training

• Developed an XGBoost model to reclassify music into popular genres, attempting to augment music discovery and recommendation capabilities

• Implemented a rudimentary recommendation pipeline with the classification model by leveraging cosine similarity values and track metadata to generate song recommendations given a YouTube URL as input
